The native token of PulseChain is PLS, which can be used to activate validators, pay for transactions and bridge to other chains. PLS has a fixed supply of four trillion tokens, which were distributed through a sacrifice phase, where users could donate any cryptocurrency or fiat currency to a list of supported addresses or charities in exchange for PLS tokens.
PLS has some features that aim to make it different from other tokens, such as:
- PLS is deflationary and PulseChain burns a portion of the transaction fees paid in PLS, reducing the supply of PLS over time.
- PulseChain implements EIP-1559, which means that every transaction on the network has a base fee that is burned and a tip that goes to the validator.
- PLS is freemium. ETH holders can transact for free with freemium PLS. This means that every ETH address that existed at the time of the fork received a free copy of its ETH balance in PLS on the Pulse network. These freemium PLS can only be used to pay for transactions and cannot be transferred or sold. This allows ETH users to enjoy the benefits of PulseChain without sacrificing their ETH.
- PulseChain uses proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanism, which means that users can stake their PLS tokens to activate validators and earn rewards for helping to secure the network. Users need at least 32 million PLS to become a validator, or they can join a staking pool with other users. Validators are randomly selected to propose and attest blocks, and they receive rewards based on their stake and performance.
