Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that relies on cryptographic techniques for security. Unlike traditional physical currencies like the dollar or euro, cryptocurrencies exist only in electronic form and are not issued or controlled by any central authority, such as a government or central bank.

At the core of cryptocurrency technology is the blockchain, a decentralized and distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This ledger ensures transparency and immutability, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or manipulate transactions.

One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is decentralization. They operate on a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions occur directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks. This decentralization has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and reduce reliance on centralized institutions.

Bitcoin, created in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most well-known and widely used. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies, often referred to as "altcoins," have been developed, each with its own unique features and use cases.

Cryptocurrencies can be used for various purposes, including online purchases, investments, remittances, and as a means of transferring value across borders. They have also given rise to innovations like smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), which have the potential to revolutionize various industries beyond finance.
